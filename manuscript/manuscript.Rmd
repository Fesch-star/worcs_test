# We recommend that you prepare your raw data for analysis in 'prepare_data.R',
# and end that file with either open_data(yourdata), or closed_data(yourdata).
# Then, uncomment the line below to load the original or synthetic data

This manuscript uses the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science [@vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2020] to ensure reproducibility and transparency. All code <!--and data--> are available at [git\@github.com:Fesch-star/worcs_test.git](mailto:git@github.com:Fesch-star/worcs_test.git){.email}.

This is an example of a non-essential citation [\@ @vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2020]. If you change the rendering function to `worcs::cite_essential`, it will be removed.

<!--The function below inserts a notification if the manuscript is knit using synthetic data. Make sure to insert it after load_data().-->

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

### my text

So apparantly you can also write in **bold** and in *italics*. You can also write the word *blue* in italics or in bold (**blue**). Could you also write italics in blue?? Nope, not according to the cheatsheet

Did I just start a new paragraph?

-   \* with a list? + and a subitem in the list? + funny

-   test bullet - bull

-   bullets are written with a -

    -   can I do this again?
    -   yes I can
    -   space - space

-   under the \* you can find a visual editor

    -   did this create a subitem in the list? Yes.
    -   can i do this again?

Lets move on to the code.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

I want to create my own coding box

```{r}
1+1
```

oh yeah!
